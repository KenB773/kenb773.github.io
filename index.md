# Welcome to my portfolio! 

If you don't know me, [here's a brief introduction](intro.md)!

## Projects
### [TryHackMe SOC Level 1](thmsoclevel1.md)

### [Home SOC Setup](homesoc.md)

### [AWS PartyRock - JargonBridge GenAI App](https://partyrock.aws/u/KenB7/1nIRFrtOV/JargonBridge) - A fun little Gen AI PartyRock tool I created for bidirectionally converting technical jargon and plain english. Includes a basic Claude-powered chatbot that can answer questions about terms used and its thought process behind the 'translations'.

### [AWS 'Silent Scalper' project](SilentScalperProj.md) - Serverless data pipeline. Using event-driven AWS architecture, my 'Silent Scalper' processes incoming files the moment theyâ€™re uploaded (without pre-provisioned infrastructure), scales automatically, and gracefully handles both success and failure paths. Aims to eliminate idle compute waste, as well as file loss resulting from crashes during unpredictable traffic spikes.

### [AWS 'Smart Vault' project](SmartVaultProj.md) - Serverless AWS automation tool - my 'Smart Vault' is used to create, tag, and manage EBS snapshots for EC2 instances based on resource tags. It features scheduled backups, audit logging via DynamoDB, and automated cleanup to reduce storage costs.
