# Welcome to my portfolio! 

If you don't know me, [here's a brief introduction](intro.md)!

## Projects

### [3-Tier Web App](3TierWebAppProj.md) - A full-stack, 3-tier Node.js web application on AWS using ECS Fargate, ALB, and RDS PostgreSQL, fully provisioned through Terraform and containerized with Docker. The project includes health checks, secure DB connectivity via SSL, and modular infrastructure-as-code for production-style scalability.

### [Docker/Kubernetes/AWS EKS/Flask - 'KubeCart' project](KubeCartProj.md) - KubeCart is a containerized Flask microservice simulating a basic shopping cart API, deployed to AWS using Kubernetes (EKS) and exposed via a public Load Balancer. It features a live Swagger UI for testing endpoints, built using Flask-RESTX and deployed with Docker, eksctl, and kubectl.

### [Azure-based Home SOC Setup](homesoc.md) - My Home SOC is a functional personal cloud security operations center built on Azure services, featuring log ingestion with Log Analytics, real-time alerting via Azure Monitor, and custom detection rules for tracking suspicious activity across a simulated home network.

### [AWS PartyRock - JargonBridge GenAI App](https://partyrock.aws/u/KenB7/1nIRFrtOV/JargonBridge) - A fun little Gen AI PartyRock tool I created for bidirectionally converting technical jargon and plain english. Includes a basic Claude-powered chatbot that can answer questions about terms used and its thought process behind the 'translations'.

### [AWS 'Silent Scalper' project](SilentScalperProj.md) - Serverless data pipeline. Using event-driven AWS architecture, my 'Silent Scalper' processes incoming files the moment theyâ€™re uploaded (without pre-provisioned infrastructure), scales automatically, and gracefully handles both success and failure paths. Aims to eliminate idle compute waste, as well as file loss resulting from crashes during unpredictable traffic spikes.

### [AWS 'Smart Vault' project](SmartVaultProj.md) - Serverless AWS automation tool - my 'Smart Vault' is used to create, tag, and manage EBS snapshots for EC2 instances based on resource tags. It features scheduled backups, audit logging via DynamoDB, and automated cleanup to reduce storage costs.
