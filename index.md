# Welcome to my portfolio! 

## Projects
### [TryHackMe SOC Level 1](thmsoclevel1.md)
### [Home SOC Setup](homesoc.md)
### [AWS PartyRock - JargonBridge GenAI App](https://partyrock.aws/u/KenB7/1nIRFrtOV/JargonBridge) - A fun little Gen AI PartyRock tool I created for bidirectionally converting technical jargon and plain english. Includes a basic Claude-powered chatbot that can answer questions about terms used and its thought process behind the 'translations'.

### [AWS 'Silent Scalper' project](SilentScalperProj.md) - Serverless data pipeline. Using event-driven AWS architecture, my 'Silent Scalper' processes incoming files the moment theyâ€™re uploaded (without pre-provisioned infrastructure), scales automatically, and gracefully handles both success and failure paths. Aims to eliminate idle compute waste, as well as file loss resulting from crashes during unpredictable traffic spikes.
