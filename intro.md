# About this portfolio

Thanks for visiting my portfolio! What will follow is a rough outline of the various aspects of my hands-on learning & experience in the realm of tech - this is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to highlight & quantify some of the tangible skills and techniques that I've practiced. Some will be personal projects, some professional and some primarily educational. I currently hold active CompTIA Security+ and Network+ CE certifications, the Google IT Support certificate, Microsoft's AZ-900 Azure Fundamental, and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect - Associate. I'm currently working on getting as much practical experience as possible through projects and hands-on work assistance before continuing with my certification path (hopefully ending up in Cloud Security/DevSecOps eventually). Much of this will be documented here in due time - please feel free to reach out directly to kenbrigham777@gmail.com with any questions, comments, suggestions etc., and thanks again for stopping by!
