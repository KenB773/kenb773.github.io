# About this portfolio

Thanks for visiting my portfolio! What will follow is a rough outline of the various aspects of my hands-on learning & experience in the realm of cyberecurity - this is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to highlight & quantify some of the tangible skills and techniques that I've practiced. Some will be personal projects, some professional and some primarily educational. I currently hold active CompTIA Security+ and Network+ CE certifications, as well as the (very much foundational) Google IT Support certificate. I'm currently working through (as of today, 2/21/2025) the TryHackMe SOC Level 1 path, as well as studying for both Azure and AWS Cloud certifications. Much of this will be documented here in due time - please feel free to reach out directly to kenbrigham777@gmail.com with any questions.
